I am very excited to announce that I will be joining Microsoft's Core Group
this summer. I do not know what specific team I will be working with, but I
hope to work in their Internet of Things or Windows OS groups.

It's been a very exciting year for Microsoft. Just this week they open sourced
the [.Net Core runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), which has builds
passing on both Windows and **Linux**, with **Mac OS X** support coming later
this year. They also announced a partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation
to allow you to run Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi **for free!** To my
understanding, you can develop applications on Windows desktop and then deploy
them to Raspberry Pi's. As someone going through the process of developing
[Python applications](https://github.com/project-nikola) on a Mac, testing them
on Windows, and deploying them to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, I can tell
you that an easy deployment system sounds very attractive.
