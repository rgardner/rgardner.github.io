I am excited to announce that Photoshop 2020 has shipped and is my first
desktop release since I joined the team in July! When you launch the
Photoshop 2020 app one of the initial loading screen lists the Photoshop team
members and, if the entropy is just right, you'll see my name listed (it
randomizes the non-leadership team members).

Alternatively, the Photoshop team members can be listed via `Photoshop > About Photoshop...` on macOS.

Because of my work on the Photoshop Imaging Engine (PIE) team, I also have
contributed changes to the new [Adobe
Fresco](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-fresco-draw-and-paint/id1458660369)
app that recently launched on iPad and UWP. Notably I contributed
locale-aware, case-insensitive, digits-as-numbers sorting to the cloud
documents organizer, among a number of bug fixes. It's an exciting time to be
contributing to the Photoshop ecosystem!
