- [Hack@Brown
2014](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/01/27/student-programmers-code-night-hackathon/)
  + Here's an "action" pic of me at Hack@Brown 2014.
  + My team tried worked on a stock market simulator. While we didn't finish
    it, I certainly learned some valuable lessons about working on a 7 person
    group in a hackathon setting. We split into client and server teams and
    updated a shared document called `server_api.py` whenever a team changed
    their API. Hilarity ensued as a team would yell "Why doesn't your code
    work!" "We changed the API, didn't you read the doc." "Oh, didn't see
    that." Going forward, I learned the importance of working in smaller teams,
    stabilizing shared API early, and setting checkpoints where both teams
    would merge and rebase so the project was nearly always in a working state.
