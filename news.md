## 2015

- [This Week in Rust: 101][twir]
  - I was mentioned as a new contributer in this issue of _This Week in Rust_.
  - I removed a compilation warning in a documentation example, which then
    caused someone else to go through the stdlib and remove similar compilation
    warnings. Now that's leverage!

  - My team presented our [Chintastic Photo Booth][hackny-project] project from

- [NYU Courant Summer Undergraduate Research Support][courant]
  - In the summer of 2014, I worked with some awesome researchers in the

- [Tech@NYU: Get to Know Bob Gardner][techatnyu-interview]

- [MSNBC host visits NYU, talks racial, economic inequality][nyu-interview]
  - I was interviewed after attending a talk by NYU's President, John Sexton, in
    celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 2014.
- [Hack@Brown 2014][hackatbrown]
  - Here's an "action" pic of me at Hack@Brown 2014.
  - My team tried worked on a stock market simulator. While we didn't finish
    it, I certainly learned some valuable lessons about working on a 7 person
    group in a hackathon setting. We split into client and server teams and
    updated a shared document called `server_api.py` whenever a team changed
    their API. Hilarity ensued as a team would yell "Why doesn't your code
    work!" "We changed the API, didn't you read the doc." "Oh, didn't see
    that." Going forward, I learned the importance of working in smaller teams,
    stabilizing shared API early, and setting checkpoints where both teams
    would merge and rebase so the project was nearly always in a working state.
