I am an undergraduate economics theory and computer science student at New York
University. I was born here in New York and lived in Connecticut through middle
school. In the summer of 2008 my family and I moved across the US to the
Seattle area.

Seattle continues to be a huge adventure for the family - hiking, biking,
Seattle sports teams, great music, and more. Moving there also came at the
perfect time for my interest in tech; I visited the Microsoft campus my
freshman year, cofounded my school's robotics club senior year, and competed in
the 3lb Beetle weight division at RoboGames (anyone remember
[BattleBots?][battlebots])

I love economics and computer science.
[Here's why.][techliberalarts]

In the fall of 2016, I will be returning to the Windows & Devices Group at
Microsoft as a full-time **Software Engineer**.

In the summer of 2015, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** in the Windows
& Devices Group at Microsoft, where I worked on internal tools to improve
Windows Push Notification Services (WNS, the P is silent).

In the summer of 2014, I was a **Junior Research Scientist** in NYU's Computer
Science Department, working with Professor Jinyang Li in the Systems Group.
There I worked on Project Spartan, a distributed array language with a similar
interface to the scientific computing library NumPy. Project Spartan is [open
source on GitHub!][spartan]

In early 2014, I was a **Data Analyst Intern** at [Kinetic
Social][kineticsocial], a social data marketing company. There I prototyped
interactive data visualizations and worked on the user interface for an
automated social media optimization tool.

During my senior year at NYU, I served as the **President** of my fraternity,
[Delta Phi][phikap] chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity. I
have also served as **Secretary** and **Technology Chair**.

During my sophomore and junior years at NYU, I was an **Executive Board
Member** of [Tech@NYU][techatnyu], the largest student tech
organization in NYC. I led the After Hours initiative (ne√© HackNights), a
weekly meetup for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs from universities in
the New York City area. [Learn more about After Hours
here.](http://www.techatnyu.org/#build-and-socialize)

During my first two years at NYU, I played the trumpet in [NYU's Music
Education Jazz Ensemble.][meje]

When I'm not in the library, in class, or at a school event, I'm probably
biking around lower Manhattan.
