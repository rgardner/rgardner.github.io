I am an undergraduate economics theory and computer science student at New York
University. I was born here in New York and lived in Connecticut through middle
school. In the summer of 2008 my family and I moved across the US to the
Seattle area.

Seattle continues to be a huge adventure for the family - hiking,
biking, Seattle sports teams, great music, and more. Moving there also came at
the perfect time for my interest in tech; I visited the Microsoft campus my
freshman year, cofounded my school's robotics club senior year, and competed in
in the 3lb Beetle weight division at RoboGames (anyone remember
[BattleBots?](https://www.battlebots.com/))

I love economics and computer science. [Here's why.](https://google.com)

I am currently a **Junior Research Scientist** with NYU's Systems team in the
Computer Science department working on Project Spartan, a distributed version
of the scientific computing library NumPy. Project Spartan is [open source on
GitHub!](https://github.com/spartan-array/spartan)

Earlier this year, I was a **Data Analyst Intern** at Kinetic Social,
prototyping interactive data visualizations and working on the user interface
for automated social media optimization.

At NYU, I am an **Executive Board Member** of Tech@NYU, the largest student
tech organization in NYC. There I lead the HackNights initiative, a weekly
meetup for programmers, designers, researchers, and entrepreneurs from
universities in the New York City area.

You can also find me playing the trumpet in [NYU's Music Education Jazz
Ensemble.](https://www.facebook.com/NYUMEJE) When I'm not in the library, in
class, or at a school event, I'm probably biking around lower Manhattan.
