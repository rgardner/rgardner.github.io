I am an undergraduate economics theory and computer science student at New York
University. I was born here in New York and lived in Connecticut through middle
school. In the summer of 2008 my family and I moved across the US to the
Seattle area.

Seattle continues to be a huge adventure for the family - hiking, biking,
Seattle sports teams, great music, and more. Moving there also came at the
perfect time for my interest in tech; I visited the Microsoft campus my
freshman year, cofounded my school's robotics club senior year, and competed in
the 3lb Beetle weight division at RoboGames (anyone remember
[BattleBots?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo3zWxO3yYs))

I love economics and computer science.
[Here's why.]({% post_url 2014-7-31-why-technology-and-liberal-arts %})

In the fall of 2016, I will be returning to the Windows & Devices Group at
Microsoft as a full-time **Software Engineer**.

In the summer of 2015, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** in the Windows
& Devices Group at Microsoft, where I worked on internal tools to improve
Windows Push Notification Services (WNS, the P is silent).

In the summer of 2014, I was a **Junior Research Scientist** in NYU's Computer
Science Department, working with Professor Jinyang Li in the Systems Group.
There I worked on Project Spartan, a distributed array language with a similar
interface to the scientific computing library NumPy. Project Spartan is [open
source on GitHub!](https://github.com/spartan-array/spartan/)

In early 2014, I was a **Data Analyst Intern** at [Kinetic
Social](http://www.kineticsocial.com/), a social data marketing company. There
I prototyped interactive data visualizations and worked on the user interface
for an automated social media optimization tool.

During my senior year at NYU, I served as the **President** of my fraternity,
[Delta Phi](http://skullhouse.nyc) chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma
International Fraternity. I have also served as **Secretary** and
**Technology Chair**.

During my sophomore and junior years at NYU, I was an **Executive Board
Member** of [Tech@NYU](http://www.techatnyu.org/), the largest student tech
organization in NYC. I led the After Hours initiative (neé HackNights), a
weekly meetup for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs from universities in
the New York City area. [Learn more about After Hours

During my first two years at NYU, I played the trumpet in [NYU's Music
Education Jazz Ensemble.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/NYU-Music-Education-Jazz-Ensemble/149497651746377)
When I'm not in the library, in class, or at a school event, I'm probably
biking around lower Manhattan.
