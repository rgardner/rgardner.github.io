title: About Me

I am a software engineer who enjoys digging into complex systems and
navigating among different technological areas. This is rooted in my
background in economics and computer science, which itself is rooted in
really enjoying all my classes in school ðŸ˜€. I always strive to understand
how customers will use my products and the role my work plays in the larger
system which informs my designs. My work on the Photoshop team at Adobe and
the Windows team at Microsoft have provided me ample opportunities in both of
these areas, and much more.

I am currently a **software engineer on the Photoshop team at Adobe**, where I improve and develop
new functionality for the Photoshop Imaging Engine (PIE), which exposes
Photoshop functionality via a cross-platform C++ library to other Adobe
products.

Before Adobe, I was a **software engineer at
Microsoft** where I worked on the [Windows 10 Setting Sync
feature][settingsync], which ensures your user settings such as Edge and IE
favorites and the desktop theme are backed up and kept in sync on all of your
Windows 10 PCs. This was an excellent challenge as I had to design new
features and fix issues that spanned the entire stack from internal API
consumers to the sync client and sync server. I also worked on the
infrastructure and design of new features for a new, unreleased cloud
service.

I live and work in NYC and have family back in Seattle, where I lived for 7
years. I love reading, the outdoors, and of course the Seattle Seahawks.

My highlights:

- I love economics and computer science. [Here's why.][techliberalarts]
- I studied abroad in Madrid in the summer of 2013, spending every week at
  [the Museuo Nacional del Prado](https://www.museodelprado.es/en)
- I was an **Executive Board Member** of [Tech@NYU][techatnyu], the largest
  student tech organization in NYC. I led the After Hours initiative (neÃ©
  HackNights), a weekly meetup for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs
  from universities in the New York City area. [Learn more about After Hours
  here.][afterhours]
- During my first two years at NYU, I played the trumpet in [NYU's Music
  Education Jazz Ensemble.][meje]
- I competed in the 3lb Beetle weight division at RoboGames in high school
  (anyone remember [BattleBots?][battlebots])
