I am a software engineer who enjoys digging into complex systems and navigating
among different technological areas.

Since the fall of 2016, I have been a **software engineer at Microsoft**
where I work on the [Windows 10 Setting Sync feature][settingsync], which
ensures your user settings such as Edge and IE favorites and the desktop
theme are backed up and kept in sync on all of your Windows 10 PCs. This has
been an excellent challenge as I've had to design new features and fix issues
that spanned the entire stack from internal API consumers to the sync client
and sync server.

Before Microsoft, I studied computer science, economics, and math at New York
University. I was born in New York and lived in Connecticut through middle
school. In the summer of 2008 my family and I moved across the US to the
Seattle area.

Seattle continues to be a huge adventure - hiking, biking, Seattle sports
teams, great music, and more. Moving there also came at the perfect time for
my interest in tech; I visited the Microsoft campus my freshman year of high
school, cofounded my school's robotics club senior year, and competed in the
3lb Beetle weight division at RoboGames (anyone remember
[BattleBots?][battlebots])

I love economics and computer science. [Here's why.][techliberalarts]

In the summer of 2015, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** in the Windows
& Devices Group at Microsoft, where I worked on internal tools to improve
Windows Push Notification Services (WNS, the P is silent).

In the summer of 2014, I was a **Junior Research Scientist** in NYU's Computer
Science Department, working with Professor Jinyang Li in the Systems Group.
There I worked on Project Spartan, a distributed array language with a similar
interface to the scientific computing library [NumPy][numpy]. Project Spartan
is [open source on GitHub!][spartan]

In early 2014, I was a **Data Analyst Intern** at [Kinetic
Social][kineticsocial], a social data marketing company. There I prototyped
interactive data visualizations and worked on the user interface for an
automated social media optimization tool.

During my senior year at NYU, I served as the **President** of my fraternity,
[Delta Phi][phikap] chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity. I
had previously served as **Secretary** and **Technology Chair**.

During my sophomore and junior years at NYU, I was an **Executive Board
Member** of [Tech@NYU][techatnyu], the largest student tech
organization in NYC. I led the After Hours initiative (ne√© HackNights), a
weekly meetup for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs from universities in
the New York City area. [Learn more about After Hours
here.][afterhours]

During my first two years at NYU, I played the trumpet in [NYU's Music
Education Jazz Ensemble.][meje]
