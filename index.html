  <p>
    I am an undergraduate junior studying economics theory and computer science
    at New York University. I've loved living in Seattle for the past seven
    years and enjoy the crazy adventure that is living and studying in New York
    City.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy my classes, the various projects I'm working on, and bicycling both
    on the trails at home and on the city streets here. At NYU, I lead the
    <a href="http://www.techatnyu.org/#build-and-socialize">After Hours</a> at
    Tech@NYU and am an active brother of the <a href="http://skullhouse.nyc">
    Delta Phi chapter</a>of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.
  </p>

  <p>Here's what I've been up to lately:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A few of us from Tech@NYU took
      <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/chintastic-photo-booth">third
        place</a> at the hackNY Spring 2015 hackathon.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable projects:</p>

      line shell written in C.
