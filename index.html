    I am a software engineer who loves biking, hiking, tennis, and puzzling.
    I work at Microsoft on the
    <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026102/windows-10-about-sync-settings">Windows 10 Setting Sync feature</a>,
    which ensures your user settings such as Edge and IE favorites and the
    desktop theme are backed up and kept in sync on all of your Windows 10
    PCs.

    I love to learn and enjoy experimenting with interesting tools and
    technologies on various side projects. While at work I design, develop, and
    maintain features in a massive C++ codebase, in my free time I've enjoyed
    exploring the unique challenges of designing software for exhibitions,
    making it easier to listen to Spotify together with friends,
    <a href="https://github.com/tuvtran/PopMap">making it safer to get home</a>,
    and learning about <a href="https://github.com/rgardner/bsh-rs">Unix shells</a>.

    Before working at Microsoft, I studied computer science, economics, and
    math at New York University in New York City. I wrote my undergraduate
    thesis on an experimental investigation into committee voting procedures,
    which combined my interest for behavioral economics and developing web
    application software in the form of an online voting application.
