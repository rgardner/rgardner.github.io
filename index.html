    Welcome to my site! My name is Bob Gardner and I am a software engineer who
    enjoys many things, including biking, hiking, tennis, contributing to open
    source software, and board games. I work on the Photoshop team at Adobe on
    the Photoshop Imaging Engine (PIE), which exposes Photoshop functionality as
    a C++ library to other Adobe products.

    I previously worked on the
    <a

      >Windows 10 Setting Sync feature</a
    >
    at Microsoft, which ensures your user settings such as Edge and IE favorites
    and the desktop theme are backed up and kept in sync on all of your Windows
    10 PCs.

    I love to learn and enjoy experimenting with interesting tools and
    technologies on various side projects. While at work I design, develop, and
    maintain features in a massive C++ codebase, in my free time I've enjoyed
    exploring the unique challenges of designing

    <a href="https://github.com/tuvtran/PopMap">making it safer to get home</a>,
    and learning about Unix shells in
    <a href="https://github.com/rgardner/bsh-rs">Rust</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/rgardner/bsh">C</a>.

    I studied computer science, economics, and math at New York University in
    New York City. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on an experimental
    investigation into committee voting procedures, which combined my interest
    for behavioral economics and developing web application software in the form
    of an online voting application.
