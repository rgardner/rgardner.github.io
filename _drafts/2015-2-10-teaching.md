I'm going to start by saying that being a good learner and being a good teacher
require different skill sets and abilities. Just because I've spent the last
twenty years in school does not mean I know how one should teach.

However, some teaching styles have worked better for me than others and
learning how to learn has been one of the hardest and most important challenges
I've faced in my life.
