During January 2014, I will not be eating meat. More specifically, I will be a
lacto-ovo-pescetarian, meaning I will still consume dairy, eggs, and fish. When
I first indicated interest in this at the end of 2013, I received mixed
reactions. Some strongly for, others neutral, and a surprising amount of people
who were strongly against. I want to begin this discussion by explaining why I
am doing this and will conclude with an explanation for the responses I
received.

###Why am I doing this?
I want to eat better. I do not consume an unhealthy amount of steak, chicken,
and bacon. Rather, I resist experimenting with other foods because of the
comfort meats provide me.

Many of us have seen the videos of turkeys being mistreated. Cows that never
leave the factory, chickens and pigs so large that they can no longer walk. This
hasn't been enough of a deterrent for me to stop eating these animals. It's not
because I don't care about the way these animals are treated, but rather I don't
have faith in the 'organic' and 'grass-fed' labels on these foods. Farming
humanely will cost consumers more money.

###Strongly For

###Strongly Against

Will I continue this into February and beyond? I'm not sure. At the moment, I
am liking its affect on my body. I am eating more fish, eggs, and fruit, the
chief goals of this experiment. The occasional headaches remind me when I need
to eat more protein and the other important amino acids that meats would
normally provide me. As I do more research and adapt my diet to make up for
these lost nutrients, it becomes easier to think about continuing this,
learning more about my body and the impacts it has on my food choice.
