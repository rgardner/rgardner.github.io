title: Books that Impacted Me
tags: [personal, books]

Books such as _Ready Player One_, _Steve Jobs_, _The UNIX Philosophy_, and
_The Art of Unit Testing: with examples in C#_ have all impacted me in
different ways (as you can imagine!). As I go through my books as part of
spring cleaning, I wanted to write about how these books (and others) have
stayed with me long after I read them.

In elementary school, I read a ton, participating in Connecticut's [Nutmeg
Book Award](https://www.nutmegaward.org/) program, reading and discussing the
nominees each year with classmates. But as sports, trumpet, homework, and
video games occupied most of my time in middle school, I fell off the personal
reading wagon. I read a ton for school, but didn't reach for books for pleasure
again until later in high school.

## Ready Player One

_Ready Player One_ by Ernest Cline was the book in high school that made me
fall in love with pleasure reading again. The book is about a kid's search
for an Easter egg in a virtual reality game world as part of a challenge to
win control of that world. It is full of 1980's pop culture references and is
a fun page-turner that made me laugh and smile. While it was adapted into a
movie a few years later, the movie had to cut out much of the pop culture fun
and many of the Easter eggs that made the book fun and special. So if you
have seen the movie and were underwhelmed or were discouraged by negative
reviews of the movie, the book is definitely worth a read. And hey, maybe
it'll help you get out of a pleasure reading slump like it did for me.

## Steve Jobs

_Steve Jobs_ by Walter Isaacson was released in the fall semester of my
senior year of high school, the height of college applications. The book was
gripping, especially to an Apple fan and someone looking for inspiration for
next steps in life. Reading the behind-the-scenes of product launches I had
seen live online and the beginning of Apple that I had only seen in _Pirates
of Silicon Valley_ and read through [folklore.org](https://www.folklore.org/)
got me even more excited about studying computer science and pursuing a
career in computing and business. But the same _Reality Distortion Field_
that led to his success hurt those around him and ultimately may have led him
to an early death.

Looking back, this book made me appreciate reading biographies to understand
how people have made decisions and the impacts of their lives on those around
them.

## The UNIX Philosophy

_The UNIX Philosophy_ by Mike Gancarz was recommended to me by my dad - I
read his original copy. It was influential in exposing me to ideas of how to
structure programs and to better understand the rationale how the tools I use
every day were intended to work together.

## The Art of Unit Testing: with examples in C Sharp

_The Art of Unit Testing: with examples in C#_ by Roy Osherove changed the way
I write tests and unit tests at work and for personal use. It helped that at
work at the time I was writing a new C#-based cloud service, so having the
examples in C# was relevant and useful. But the lessons extend beyond a
specific programming language. This is also the first book I've given to a
coworker to help them with their test writing.

Specific lessons:

- There are 3 types of unit tests:
  - test return value
  - test state changes (verify side-effects on the subject under test)
  - test interactions with other objects (verify side-effects on other objects)
- in object oriented tests, there are _fakes_, _mocks_, and _stubs_
- Test Driven Development (TDD) helps validate designs
- write failing test first before passing test to verify the test is failing
  as expected

I practice test driven development and advocate for good tests to accompany
changes and am lucky to have worked on teams that care a lot about code
quality. This book gave me practical advice on how to improve my test writing
experience. I now find it more enjoyable and I am more productive in the dev
inner loop.
