title: Why Technology and Liberal Arts?
tags: Meta

I'm writing this blog to tell a story, a narrative about *our* relationship with
technology. This will not necessarily be a story of my life - though some posts
will be personal - but rather a narrative about technology's relationship with
us: our social and economic interactions. I do not think about technology in
isolation and that's not how I plan to write about it.

For my first post, I want to explain why I chose the subtitle "Thoughts from the
intersection of technology and liberal arts" for the blog. This outro to the
iPad 2 event struck a chord with me when I heard it nearly three years ago.

That was Steve Jobs describing the "post-pc era" that the iPad helped initiate.

It's kind of amusing now, in hindsight. I used to talk about Jobs a lot. My
first computer was an Apple PowerBook that my father hadn't touched in years. In
middle and high school I would read dozens of articles a week about Apple,
usually nothing more than baseless rumors; I knew that, too, at the time. I
would read about other technology companies, about products they had released,
products they had announced, and of course, more rumors. Just like the
articles, when talking and thinking about tech I focused on specs: how much
RAM and hard disk capacity, what ports and transfer speeds; quantifying lighter
and faster in terms most people in the world do not understand.

Over the years, I looked more and more at the implications of lighter and
faster. Talking about computers in terms of Megabits and Gigabytes never led to
interesting discussions in school, for either me or the (usually) less enthused
person I spoke with. It is the implications of these specs and of these rumors
that excite me.

Why is Amazon developing drones for their vision of the package delivery service
of the future instead of investing in driverless cars? What are the implications
of Google Glass for our conceptions of knowledge and privacy? And probably most
important, why don't I ever hear my phone when it rings?

So with that brief introduction, and hopefully with the blog posts that follow,
you appreciate why I chose this subtitle and its implications.

And so our story begins...
