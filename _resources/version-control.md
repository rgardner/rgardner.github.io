title: Version Control
---

Here is a collection of links, books, and references that I have personally
looked at or used at one time or another. I'm organizing this page into
sections based off of its target audience. While these are just
recommendations, this is a natural order in proceeding through anything. If you
are unsure of what category you belong in, check out a link or two and adjust
based on what you understand.

## Newbies
What's version control? From Wikipedia:

> Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an
> aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to
> documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
> information.

## Working Proficiency
You know what `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status` do. But how I do work
with groups? How do I use GitHub?

## Advanced
How do I set up my own private GitHub?

## Hosting
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  + The most popular of the version control hosting platforms. This should be
    your first stop unless the lack of free private hosting is a problem (or if
    your developers are on a different platform).
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
  + BitBucket is popular because of their support for free repositories and
    because of their first class support of other version control tools
    (`svn`).
- [Google Code](https://code.google.com/)
  + I do not recommend Google Code unless you are working on an open source
    project that is already on Google Code.
- [Microsoft Codeplex](https://www.codeplex.com/)
  + I do not recommend CodePlex unless you are a .Net developer. Microsoft has
    begun moving some of their projects to [their GitHub](http://microsoft.github.io/).
    I make the note about .Net because many .Net projects are still being
    actively developed on the Codeplex platform.
