title: Version Control
---

Here is a collection of links, books, and references that I have personally
looked at or used at one time or another. I'm organizing this page into
sections based off of its target audience. While these are just
recommendations, this is a natural order in proceeding through anything. If you
are unsure of what category you belong in, check out a link or two and adjust
based on what you understand.

## Newbies

What's version control? From Wikipedia:

> Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an
> aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to
> documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
> information.
