I use [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) to quickly find files by name. I
find the interface easier to remember than `find`.

I use [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to quickly find code
on my computer. Unlike `grep`, `ripgrep` automatically filters out files that
are ignored in VCS. I also use GitHub's code search to look for examples of
how to configure certain tools (e.g. `setup.py`, `Cargo.toml`) and find
sample API usage. At Microsoft, I loved a tool called Research that enabled
me to search huge quantities of code quickly.
