[TeX] is a document preparation program and language. [LaTex] is a program that
extends TeX with extra formatting and functionality. You can read more about
the [differences between TeX and LaTeX here]. TeX is pronounced "tekh" and
LaTex is pronounced "lah-tekh" or "lay-tekh". For most intents and purposes,
people say TeX and LaTeX interchangeably, but actually use LaTeX to prepare
their documents.
